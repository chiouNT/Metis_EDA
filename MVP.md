* **Goal:** The analysis seeks to charaterize the ridership changes of MTA stations before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. This data will be informative for the street vendors to reopening their business.
* **Process:** Data exploration to reach this conclusion includes the aggregation daily entry data at the MTA station level on March. The data is then compared between 2019 and 2022.
* **Preliminary visualization:** The top figure depicts the ratio of the entries on March between 2022 and 2019. It showed that most stations have ~37% reduction in the ridership. The top right figure shows that some of stations that have less total entries are less reduced in the ridership in 2022. The bottom left and right figures illustrate the stations with the highest reduction (>70%) and the lowest reduction (>50%) in the ridership, respectively.
