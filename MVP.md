##  The impact of COVID-19 on switching the street vendor locations around the MTA stations
* **Goal:** The analysis seeks to identify stations that show the changes in the ridership before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, which will be used for determining whether the street vendors need to change their business locations. 
* **Process:** Data exploration to reach this conclusion includes the aggregation daily entry data at the MTA station level on March. The data is then compared between 2019 and 2022.
* **Preliminary visualization:** The top figure depicts the ratio of the entries on Marchbetween 2022 and 2019. It showed that most stations have ~40% reduction in the ridership. The bottom left and right figures illustrate the stations with the highest reduction (>70%) and the lowest reduction (>50%) in the ridership, respectively.
* **Preliminary conclusion:** It suggests that the street venders at the stations, such as Wall st station, may need to relocate to other stations or change their business strategies as the ridership in 2022 is only ~10% of that in 2019.
